        «Anything that can go wrong will go wrong». This phrase belongs to an engineer Edward Murphy. According to legend, the man said these words when he saw how a plane propeller suddenly began to revolve in the opposite direction.<br/>
        <br/>
        In real life, the influence of Murphy’s law may be noticed when a sandwich is being dropped. A toast lands buttered side down, but does it really always work this way?

        On the website you may check if the engineer’s statement is true. Press the button and you will have a result at the top of the page. The number of «up-s» and «down-s» is written on the left and right. Moreover, it is indicated by red and green colours. It is recommended to drop the sandwich a lot of times for greater accuracy of your experiment. To reset the data you have to reload the page.
